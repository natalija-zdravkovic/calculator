# Calculator  
Description   
This is a simple implementation of a basic calculator in the browser. The project allows users to perform arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It includes functionality for clearing the current input, deleting the last character, and adding decimal points for more precise calculations.   

The goal of this project is to practice working with JavaScript functions, DOM manipulation, event handling, and dynamically updating content based on user interactions. It also provides practice with CSS for styling and creating a clean, user-friendly interface.
